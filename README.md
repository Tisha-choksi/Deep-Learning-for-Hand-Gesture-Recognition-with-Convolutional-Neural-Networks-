# Deep-Learning-for-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-
This project involves building a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to correctly recognize hand gestures by a user to control a smart TV.

The objective of this projects is to build a hand gesture recognition model that can be hosted on a camera installed in a smart TV that can understand 5 gestures. Namely, leftwards hand movement to go to previous channel, rightward hand movement to go to next channel, upward hand movement to increase the volume, downward hand movement to decrease the volume and a palm gesture to pause playing the video.
